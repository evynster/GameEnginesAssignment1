# GameEnginesAssignment1

This project is made for my Game Engine Design Class

The full goal of this larger project is to make a stealth shooter game.

For this specific assignment I have implemented movement, camera controls, some interesting movement mechanics using some prefabs I have made,
and a small game to see how lucky you can be.
